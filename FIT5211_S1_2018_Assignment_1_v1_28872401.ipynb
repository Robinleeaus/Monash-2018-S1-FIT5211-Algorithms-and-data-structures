    "* You must work on this assignment individually.\n",
    "* This assignment contributes 20% towards your final mark in FIT5211.\n",
    "* The subjects are computational complexity, recursion, divide-and-conquer and search.\n",
    "* The exercises are roughly given by increasing difficulty. Obtaining a 110% mark may be very hard, depending on your background, and will probably take many hours. The assignment is written such that everyone can correctly complete the first exercises, but it is likely that the last ones will only be succesfully completed by few. If your mark exceeds 100, the extra points will be counted towards Assignment 2, for a maximum of 100 marks.\n",
    "* The expected deliverable is this Jupyter Notebook, completed with your answers.\n",
    "* For questions on this assigment, please use the Moodle forum https://moodle.vle.monash.edu/mod/forum/view.php?id=4764773.\n",
    "* The deadline is April 20, 23:55 via Moodle: https://moodle.vle.monash.edu/course/view.php?id=42910&section=5. If this does not work, and only in this case, send your Notebook to pierre.lebodic@monash.edu.\n",
